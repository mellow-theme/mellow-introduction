    Typography
  </h1>
  <p pg-xxxl pg-en>
    I use <strong text-deepPlum-500>Open Sans</strong> as my main font. It is a sans-serif font with a geometric touch. It is a very versatile font that can be used in many different contexts. It is also very readable and has a good contrast.

      About line-height
    </h2>
    <p pg-xxl pg-en>
      I use a line-height of <strong text-aquaGreen-500>1.3</strong> for English heading and <strong text-vividOrange-500>1.5</strong> for Chinese heading.
      And I use a line-height of <strong text-coralRed-500>1.5</strong> for all my English text and <strong text-brightBlue-500>1.7</strong> for Chinese text. These values are good for readability and it is also a good value for the spacing between the lines.

      And I use a margin of <strong text-coralRed-500>font-size * 0.5</strong> for all my text.
